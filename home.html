      <h2>Introduction to Oil Spills</h2>
      <p>An oil spill occurs when oil is released into the environment, typically in water bodies like oceans, seas, or rivers. These spills can have devastating effects on marine life, including marine mammals. This most prevalant causes of oil spills include accidents occurring during oil drilling or production activities, such as rig collapses or pipe ruptures, constitute significant contributors to these incidents. Additionally, incidents involving tankers and vessels engaged in oil transportation can result in leaks or collisions, leading to substantial oil spills. The failure or damage of pipelines and storage facilities also presents a notable risk, as it can lead to the unintended release of oil. </p>

      <h2>Why Marine Mammals Are Vulnerable</h2>
      <p>Marine mammals, such as whales, dolphins, and seals, are particularly vulnerable to oil spills due to their dependence on the marine environment for survival. The oil can coat their fur or feathers, impair their ability to move or breathe, and contaminate their food sources.</p>

      <h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
      <p>Oil companies can play a crucial role in preventing and mitigating the impact of oil spills on marine mammals. Some potential solutions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing stringent safety protocols to minimize the risk of spills</li>
        <li>Using advanced technologies for early detection and rapid response to spills</li>
        <li>Investing in research and development of eco-friendly oil spill cleanup methods</li>
        <li>Supporting conservation organizations and initiatives dedicated to protecting marine mammals</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Jaw-dropping stats</h2>
      <p>Oil spills have a huge impact on the ocean, and it's probably a lot bigger than you think.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the year 2023, one large spill (>700 tonnes) and nine medium spills (7-700 tonnes) were recorded.This brings the decade average to 6.8 spills (>7 tonnes) per year. This is on a par with the average for the 2010s.</li>
        <li>The total volume of oil lost to the environment from tanker spills in 2023 was approximately 2,000 tonnes.</li>
        <li>In the 2020s to date, there have been 27 spills of 7 tonnes and over, resulting in 28,000 tonnes of oil lost. 91% of this amount can be attributed to 5 large incidents and 9% to the remaining 22 incidents. That is a lot of oil that can harm marine life! :0</li>
