<h2>Physical Effects</h2>
<p1>Oil spills have detrimental effects on marine mammals, hindering their movement and submergence as the oil smothers and restricts them. Oil destroys the insulating ability of fur-bearing mammals, such as sea otters, and the water repellency of a bird's feathers, thus exposing these creatures to the harsh elements. Without the ability to repel water and insulate from the cold water, mammals and birds will die from hypothermia.
Moreover, high concentrations of ingested oil prove toxic. The coating of fur or feathers reduces insulation and buoyancy, rendering these creatures vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and hypothermia. Marine mammals may ingest oil through contaminated prey or grooming, resulting in damage to their digestive system, liver, and kidneys. Inhalation of oil vapors or droplets can lead to respiratory issues, including lung damage. Direct contact with oil causes skin irritation, burns, and infections. Reproductive failure or even death can occur due to oil exposure, and alterations in behavior can make marine mammals more susceptible to predators or less proficient in hunting.</p1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>If an oil spill happens in an area with wildlife the damage can be significant. Oil destroys the insulating ability of fur on mammals and impacts the water repelling qualities of a bird's feathers, without the insulation or water repelling qualities mammals and birds can die from hypothermia. Dolphins and whales can inhale oil, which has an impact on their immune system and can impact reproduction. While fish and shellfish aren't immediately impacted, because oil floats on water, as the oil mixes and sinks, fish can experience impacted growth, enlarged livers, fin erosion and a reduction in reproductive capabilities. In fish and shellfish, the impact can also be lethal, when it is not lethal, they are often no longer safe for human consumption.</p></section>

<h2>Additional Info and impacts on other forms of life</h2>
<ul>
<li><p1>Marine Mammals: The most common marine mammals at risk in oil spills in U.S. waters are 13 species of seals and sea lions (several are endangered or threatened species). Effects include suffocation or respiratory damage by oil, loss of insulation, and poisoning. Most vulnerable are animals that have fur for insulation such as fur seals and sea otters.  </p1></li>

<li><p1>Fish: Fish may be more resistant than other marine organisms to oil because their surfaces, including gills, are coated with oil repellent mucus, although larval fish, which may concentrate at the surface (with the oil) may be more vulnerable. Fish can be affected through the gills, by ingestion, or by eating oiled prey.</p1></li>

<li><p1>Shellfish: A good deal of study has been done on the effects of oil on shellfish, both bottom dwelling (lobsters, crabs, etc.) and intertidal (clams, oysters, etc.) Species living in bays, estuaries and other shallow environments are at particular risk because oil coming ashore may become concentrated. In addition to the toxic effects, heavy oils can literally smother and immobilize some invertebrate species. Sub-lethal effects are also seen, including changes in growth, metabolism, reproduction and behaviors.</p1></li>
