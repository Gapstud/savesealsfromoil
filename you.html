<h2>Physical Actions</h2>
<p1>Chronic oil spills are also damaging like street runoff and improper oil disposal. This is stuff people like YOU participate in and thus you can help and take action on issues concerning this matter. Immediately report oil or chemical spills (800-424-8802), properly recycle used motor oil, carefully fuel cars or boats, promptly repair leaks, and take energy conservation steps. As a voter and consumer, your opinion is valued by your elected officials and companies you patronize.</p1>

 <li><a href="https://oceana.org/resources/ways-to-give-donate-now/"><button>Donate to OCEANA</button></a><section><p>Oceana is a non-profit organization that focuses on fighting on the field of policy, making sure the government protects marine life by implementing ocean conservation policies. Its current project against oil spills is a campaign to get authroities to stop the expansion of offshore drilling. Offshore drilling is detrimental to the ocean, causing lots of pollution, and is a large cause of the oil spills that harm marine life. So far, about 75,000 miles of coastline in the US and Belize have been protected from offshore drilling, covering more than 2.5 million square miles of ocean. They continue to fight offshore drilling, and also promote responsibly sourced offshore wind as a climate-friendly alternative. Donate now to contribute to this awesome initiative!</p></section></li>
 <li><a href="https://secure.ifaw.org/international/donate?_ga=2.147234036.2114596631.1714276269-1593966417.1714276269"><button>Donate to the IWAF</button></a><section><p>The IWAF is a global organization that works to protect animals and their habitats. They have specific programs focused on responding to oil spills and providing rescue and rehabilitation for affected wildlife, including marine mammals. Donations to IFAW support their emergency response efforts and help save and protect marine animals impacted by oil spills. An ongoing project launched in 2021 aims to work together with a partner organization called Sea Alarm and governmental authorities from various countries in the Middle East on how to rescue wildlife affected by oil spills. They have held multiple training sessions regarding topics including capturing, transporting, stabilizing, washing, providing veterinary care and releasing oiled animals. They also review factors including the effects of oil on wildlife, the stages of developing preparedness and how to effectively manage oiled wildlife response operations. These trainings were encouraged and supported due to concerns regarding oil spillage from the Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) Safer Tanker in the Red Sea. Located north of the Yemen city of Al-Hudaydah and estimated to contain about 1.14 million barrels of oil, the tanker poses a risk of a serious environmental disaster.</section></p>
 <section><p>Since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the discovery of oil in the mid-1900s, the geopolitical significance of the Region and the importance of these waters for international trade have grown enormously. Many of the bird and marine species found around the Red Sea are endangered and already under pressure due to numerous threats such as overhunting, overfishing, and climate change. A serious oil spill on top of those pressures may further threaten the survival of many of these species. Preparedness plans need to be in place for dealing with any marine wildlife affected by an oil spill in the Red Sea.</p></section>
 <section><p>The regional directer of the IFAW explains, "IFAW and Sea Alarm are ready to provide support and cooperate with governments and the oil industry in the Middle East and North Africa to work together to set up the right response plan to protect birds and marine wildlife effected by oil spills in the region." Any donations could help save a life! DONATE NOW!!!</p></section></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/get-involved/ways-to-give/donations"><button>Donate to The Marine Mammal Center</button></a><section><p>You can also donate to The Marine Mammal Center, a non-profit animal hospital. They play a large role in saving animals caught in the middle of oil spills. One of their patients rescued was a California Sea Lion called Twig, who was released after having poor body condition and oil/tar spots on his fur after an oil spill. Donate today to save a life!</p></button></li>
 <li><a href="mrsc.org"><button>Featured organization: the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MRSC)</button></a><section><p>Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) is the largest oil spill removal organization (OSRO) in the United States offering complete, credible OSRO coverage across the country. Formed in conjunction with the Marine Preservation Association in 1990 by oil and gas companies, they are a not-for-profit organization with U.S. Coast Guard OSRO classification in every U.S. captain of the port zone except Alaska. They help marine mammals return to a clean ocean as fast as possible after an oil spill!</p></section></li>
