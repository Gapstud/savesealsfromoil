<div class="box"><h2>Cleaning up Oil Spills</h2></div>
<p>If a team can reach an oil spill within a few hours, their goal is to control and remove the oil using mechanical methods. Containment and skimming techniques are employed, utilizing tools like booms and skimmers. Booms are floating barriers that prevent the oil from spreading further, while skimmers, which are modified boats, skim the oil off the water's surface.

<p>As the oil approaches the shoreline or disperses, the cleanup process becomes more challenging. In such cases, manual cleanup operations are typically initiated, while also employing tactics to deter wildlife from the affected area, such as using floating dummies and balloons. One can also use chemical substances like oil sorbents and dispersants. These can be used on water or land. Dispersants, also called dispersing agents, are chemical agents used to break up oil into smaller droplets in the water column. Dispersants can be applied on surface oil or below the surface, closer to an uncontrolled release of crude oil from a well blowout source. Sorbents are materials used to absorb oil, and include peat moss, vermiculate, and clay. Synthetic varieties - usually plastic foams or fibers - come in sheets, rolls, or booms. 
</p>

<p>It's important to note that no method can completely eliminate the oil. In the best-case scenario, mechanical methods can only clean up around 40 percent of the spilled oil. Natural recovery processes can play a significant role in restoring the environment, and efforts to enhance its effectiveness should be taken into consideration.</p>

    <div class="box"><h2>Oil spill prevention methods (precautions)</h2></div>
    <p>Measures oil companies can implement to make their construction of oil pipelines safer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Regular inspections: identifying signs of corrosion or damage often using advanced tech like robot crawlers, sensors that detect temperature change pressure change, and flow change, and remotely operated vehicles.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cathodic protection: technique to prevent corrosion in offshore pipelines. Pipeline connected to a sacrificial anode like zinc or magnesium which corrodes instead of pipeline. A sacrificial anode is the main component of a galvanic cathodic protection system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion. They are made from a metal alloy with a more "active" voltage than the metal of the structure
</p></li>
        <li><p>Emergency shutdown systems: shutdown of flow when detection of spill happens to minimize effect.
</p></li>
        <li><p>Blowout preventers: series of valves that can close to prevent uncontrolled release of oil.
</p></li>
        <li><p>Pipeline monitoring: monitoring of pipelines with advanced tech like fiber optic sensors and acoustic sensors that can detect change in temp, pressure, and flow, and can alert operators of any potential issues.
</p></li>

    </ul>
